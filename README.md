# Sakura 

Sakura is a game. Platformer.
All the player has to do is gather the 16 sakura-tree things on the platforms 
and then go under or -jump onto-  the Sakura tree at the level's end!

You cannot die but in the end you get a Game Over anyway


*not finished yet, probably will never be finished, it's for learning purposes and it's bad*
